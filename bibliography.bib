	abstract = {From the Publisher:A basic problem in computer vision is to understand the structure of a real world scene given several images of it. Recent major developments in the theory and practice of scene reconstruction are described in detail in a unified framework. The book covers the geometric principles and how to represent objects algebraically so they can be computed and applied. The authors provide comprehensive background material and explain how to apply the methods and implement the algorithms directly.}
