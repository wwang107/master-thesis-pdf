\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:introduction}
In this work, we propose a simple end-to-end fully convolutional framework that let a 2D joint estimator aware of multiple views. To train a 2D joint estimator without using any bounding box of person, we propose a simple yet effective weighted loss using the binary threshold method on groundtruth heatmaps to balance positive and negative examples. Moreover, we propose a method to let a 2D joint estimator aware of other views using epipolar geometry.

Our work came across some caveats when trying to aggregate multi-view information based on heatmaps and can be a great reference to other work within the same topic.
